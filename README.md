2. Set up proper logging and monitoring.
3. Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches.
4. Use environment variables for sensitive data.
5. Implement rate limiting and other security measures.

# LAWFULLY_FLARE - Immigration Case Management System

## Overview

The LAWFULLY_FLARE Immigration Case Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management, processing, and tracking of immigration cases. Built with a modern tech stack, this application provides legal professionals, clients, and administrators with a robust platform to handle complex immigration workflows, document management, and case communications.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Case Management Dashboard**: Centralized overview of all active cases with status tracking
- **Document Management**: Secure storage, organization, and retrieval of case-related documents
- **Client Portal**: Self-service access for clients to view case status and submit information
- **Automated Notifications**: Email and in-app alerts for case updates, deadlines, and appointments
- **Task Management**: Assignment and tracking of case-related tasks
- **Calendar Integration**: Schedule and manage appointments, deadlines, and reminders
- **Form Generation**: Auto-filling and generation of standard immigration forms

### Advanced Logging System
The application implements a robust logging system across all components:

#### Logger Configuration (src/config/logger.js)
- Configures Winston logger with multiple log levels (error, warn, info, http, debug)
- Implements colorized console output for development environments
- Sets up file transport for production environments:
  - `error.log` for error-level logs
  - `combined.log` for all logs
- Includes timestamps and consistent formatting for all log messages

#### Logger Utilities (src/utils/loggerUtils.js)
- Provides specialized utility functions for different logging needs:
  - `logError`: Captures error details with context and stack traces
  - `logInfo`: Records general application information and events
  - `logWarning`: Documents potential issues requiring attention
  - `logDebug`: Stores detailed debugging information for development
- Implements context-aware logging with metadata for effective troubleshooting

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI library
- **Redux**: State management
- **Material-UI**: Component library for consistent design
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API calls
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: Testing framework
- **Winston**: Logging library

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web application framework
- **MongoDB**: Document database for case data
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling
- **JWT**: Authentication and authorization
- **Multer**: File upload handling
- **Winston**: Logging infrastructure

### DevOps

### Production Deployment
Refer to the deployment documentation in `docs/deployment.md` for detailed instructions on setting up a production environment.

## Architecture Overview

The Immigration Case Management System follows a microservices architecture pattern:

### System Components
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
- **Case Management Service**: Core business logic for case processing
- **Document Service**: Manages document uploads, storage, and retrieval
- **Notification Service**: Handles emails, alerts, and reminders
- **Client Portal**: User interface for clients
- **Admin Dashboard**: Interface for staff and administrators

### Data Flow
1. Requests from clients/admin interfaces are authenticated by the Auth Service
2. Validated requests are routed to appropriate microservices
3. Services process requests and interact with the database layer
4. Responses are returned through the API gateway
5. All significant events are captured by the logging system

## Contributing Guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Implement your changes with appropriate tests
3. Follow the code style guidelines in `.eslintrc`
4. Submit a pull request against the `main` branch
5. Ensure CI checks pass before requesting review

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow established naming conventions
- Write unit tests for all new features
- Document API endpoints using JSDoc
- Use the logging utilities for all error handling

## Security Measures

The Immigration Case Management System implements various security features:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh token rotation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control system
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events
- **Regular Updates**: Dependency monitoring and updates
- **Secure Headers**: Implementation of security-related HTTP headers
