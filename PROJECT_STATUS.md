## Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Vulnerabilities**
  - Frontend dependencies have known vulnerabilities that need to be addressed
  - Temporary use of .env files in version control (should be removed)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code Quality**
  - Error logging currently uses error.log files instead of proper logging system
  - Some components have incomplete error handling
  - Inconsistent use of async/await vs promises in some files

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Debt**
  - Some duplicate code remains in utility functions
